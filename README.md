1. Problem Description

Air travel is becoming increasingly complex with multiple variables impacting the same. The flight delay is one of such variables that impacts carrier, Airport and
passenger and may result in significant commercial loss or reputation loss to all the stakeholders and thus huge cost on the economy. Thus, prediction of
delay is crucial not only from view point of customer from time management perspective and carrier for retention of customer faith but also from Airport
point of view for managing the traffic more efficiently to optimise the number of arriving flights by appropriate adjustment of schedules. The contribution of
weather conditions has been identified to be the very important contributor of these delays.

2. Data Understanding
•	Given flight and weather details for 2004 & 2005. 
•	Also, Given Weather data is for every hour. 
•	Target variable has to be derived from given Scheduled arrival, Actual arrival time by using if flight is delay only if delay time is more than 15 Mins.
•	Target variable is distributed between 80:20
•	There are few airports which doesn't are connected to any weather stations.
